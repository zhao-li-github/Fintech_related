1. Credit prediction
do feature engineering for columns without missing values
build a ML model using LightGBM to see how accurate it is without one-hot encoding (LightGBM can deal with it as well) and with missing values
perform one-hot encoding for all categorical features
build and evaluate ML models using 9 commonly used supervised learning algorithms
fill out missing values in "Checking account" and "Saving accounts" with constant "missing", re-do feature engineering, over-sample the minority class using SMOTE technique, then re-train the ML models in 4
