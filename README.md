## 1. Credit risk prediction   
### Goal   
In this project, I explored the German credit dataset and built supervised machine learning models to predict whether a person has a good or bad credit, based on features including age, gender, housing status, career status, bank accounts information, and loan information (duration and purpose).    
### Content   
-- Performed exploratory data analysis    
-- Used "one-hot" encoding for categorical features (including features with missing values), and built models using 9 common supervise learning algorithms: LightGBM, logistic regression, knn, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost   
-- Imputed missing values with constant, and oversampled minority group using SMOTE technique, and then re-built and evaluated models     
-- Identified most predictive features
